# GoRetro
GoRetro is a [NES](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nintendo_Entertainment_System) emulator written in pure Go.

It utilizes the algorithm described in the popular paper [Depixelizing Pixel Art](https://johanneskopf.de/publications/pixelart/).  By applying the algorithm on each frame pre-render, GoRetro can play your favourite NES classics in what we affectionately call **Watercolor Mode**.
